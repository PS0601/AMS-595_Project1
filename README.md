# Monte Carlo Estimation of π  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of the **Monte Carlo simulation method** to estimate the value of π.  
The basic idea is to randomly generate points inside a square and check how many of them fall inside a quarter circle. By comparing the ratio of inside points to the total points, we can approximate π.  

The project is divided into three tasks:  
1. **Task 1 (For Loop):** Runs the simulation for fixed sample sizes and plots results.  
2. **Task 2 (While Loop):** Runs the simulation until a specified level of precision is reached.  
3. **Task 3 (Function + Visualization):** Wraps the simulation into a function with user input and live scatter plots.
